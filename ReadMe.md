This is a simple backup & restore script for my M-series Macs. 

As an IT person working in user services, it's easy to use your computer to test something and bork it while testing something.  This tool helps me ensure that I get everything backed up, stored, REstored, and deployed quickly in the event of such a rebuild.

Nothing fancy.  Just trashy function.
